Piped-Material is a fork of [Piped](https://github.com/TeamPiped/piped), an alternative client to YouTube. I have tried to improve the performance, the design and efficiency.

There are a few things that PM does better, like watch history tracking, and compares favorably to Piped's features.

As a byproduct, the code is also much cleaner, dysfunctional patterns and paradigms have been replaced with clean, beautiful code :).

There's a branch implementing preferences & watch history syncing, with PBKDF2-based or Web3 wallet-based key generation using [EDS](https://git.maharshi.ninja/root/libeds) at the `feature-eds_2` branch. This is deployed [at eds-v2.piped.১.net](https://eds-v2.piped.১.net).

Production instances are updated infrequently, and do not include features that are introduced recently without extensive testing.

## Self-hosting

There's a Dockerfile to build a Piped-Material deployment (using a simple nginx server hosting the SPA files) [located here](https://github.com/mmjee/pm-docker). It can be customized with build arguments. Piped-Material is just a SPA so `yarn install; yarn run build` is enough to generate static files.
